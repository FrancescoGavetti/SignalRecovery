# SignalRecovery
Signal Recovery is a course taught by Professor Ivan Rech to master students in electronics engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
The course is split in three main sections:
1. Signals and Noise
  - Introduction to measurements, errors and statistical distributions
  - Mathematical threatment of signals and noise in the time- and frequency-domain
  - Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR)
  - Autocorrelation functions, energy and power spectra
  - Noise sources in electronic circuits and sensors
  - Main types of noise spectra
  - Noise interpretation and modeling with statistical pulse sequences

2. Extracting signals from noise
  - Linear filters with constant parameters and with time-variant parameters, action on signals and noise and resultant SNR
  - Pulse-signals and constant-parameter low-pass filters
  - Gated Integrator (GI)
  - Boxcar Integrator (BI)
  - Sample & Hold (S&H) and fast samplers
  - Discrete filtering by sampling and weighted average of samples
  - Optimum filtering for pulse-amplitude measurements, significance and practical usefulness
  - Noise with 1/f spectrum: characteristic features and ensuing problem, filtering approach
  - Constant-parameter high-pass filters
  - Correlated double sampling (CDS) and further developments
  - Baseline Restorer (BLR)
  - Periodic signals and constant-parameter resonant filters
  - Modulation of signals and noise
  - Lock-in Amplifier (LIA), analog and digital implementations of LIAs

3. Sensors
  - Device structure and technology
  - Characteristic features and electrical parameters
  - Output signals and information content
  - Equivalent electric circuit
  - Internal noise
  - Photodetectors:
    - Vacuum tube and semiconductor photodiodes
    - Photoconductors
    - Photomultiplier tubes (PMT)
    - Avalanche photodiodes (APD)
    - Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD)
    - Analog and digital detection
    - Single-photon counting (SPC)
    - Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)
  - Temperature sensors:
    - Thermo resistances
  - Strain and Force Sensors:
    - Strain gauges sensors
